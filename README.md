# ODRL Policy Instantiation spec

This specification document has the aim to provide a starting point 
to standardize the instantiation of an Agreement based on a set of
ODRL Policies, an ODRL Request and a knowledge graph of the state 
of the world modeled as RDF.

The envisioned application is the automated generation of Agreements
by policy systems as the basis of generating automated contracts of
data exchanged based on singing these agreements between parties.
